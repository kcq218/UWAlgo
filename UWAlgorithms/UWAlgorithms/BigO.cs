     * N denotes input
     * 
     * 
     * O(1) does not depend on size of input
     * time to run code is the same regardless of N
     * Does not change when N changes
     * Also known as Constant time.
     * O(1) does not indicate fast, 
     * it just indicates time does not depend on size of input
     * 
     * O(N)
     * The number of iterations of the loop changes as the same rate as N
     * Linear runtime
     * Example of O(N) operations
     * Finding a max element in an unsorted array
     * Finding all elements with a certain value in an unsorted array.
     * Finding if an element exists in an unsorted array
     * 
     * O(N^2)
     * O(N^2) is more expensive than O(1) and O(N)
     * Run time grows rate of square of the input size.
     * O(N^2) is also known as quadratic.
     * 
     * Examples
     * Sum all elements in an N x N matrix.
     * Bubble sort algorithm
     * Insertion sort algorithm

     * 
     * O(log N)
     * Faster than O(N) and O(N^2)
     * log is base 2
     * rate of growth is much smaller than n
     * Run time is halved every iteration
