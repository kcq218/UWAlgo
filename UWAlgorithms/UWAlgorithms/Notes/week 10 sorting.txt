i.e the first run will have largest number at the end
when the pass thru is sorted it is done.

selection sort
find the smallest element and swap with current index being compared to
o of n complexity

Merge sort
O of N space
best and worst case is n log n
divides list until it gets to size 1
then merges them into sorted list of size 2
then 4....

Quicksort
best case is o n log n
worst case is o n 2
