Binary Heap
Complete Binary Tree
and has heap ordering property

Min Heap
Value of each node >= value of its parent node
parent is smaller than its children
smallest value is at the root
one value is also a min heap

Max Heap
Parent is >= either of its childern
parent is bigger than its children
biggest value is at the root.
one value could be a max heap too

Array representation of heap
starts at 1
goes from middle, left , right, left right....
left child is 2 * i
right child is 2 * i + 1
parent is i/2
height of binary heap is log n
leaf node is n/2 + 1 to n
90% of nodes is at the bottom
last level is n/2
second level is n/4
third level is n/8

Generate min heap
start at leaf level
