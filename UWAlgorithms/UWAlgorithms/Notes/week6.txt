Binary Tree

Leaf node means the node does not have a left or right node

Height of a node is the height from the deepest node or the ground.\
Depth

Root subtree is the root of the right or left tree.
Height of a root node is 1+ height of the deepest subtree

number of node is 2^(h+1) - 1
Balance tree maximum difference in depth between any two leaf node is 1

complete tree has two nodes on all level with the exception of last level which is still filled from left to right. 
Balanced Tree means any leaft node is 1 or less in height difference in compare to any other leaf node. 

Traversal
Dethp First Traversal
Breadth First Traversal

Good way to remember order is the location of the root.

Pre-order Traversal
root, left, right
a,b,d,e,c,f,g

in-order Traversal
left, root, right

Post order
left, right, root



BST 

every BST is a BT but not every BT is BST.

value held by left subtree is <= than the parent's node value
value held by right subtree is > than the parent's node value
BTS O(N) time and space complexity. 
height of a complete tree is about log2n
worse case bst search is the height of tree. 
if the tree is not balanced it could have worst than ologn
